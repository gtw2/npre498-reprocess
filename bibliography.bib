	abstract = {In order to enhance the throughput of a pyroprocessing in which electrochemical processes are
mostly engaged, the design of a continuous concept is required. The graphite cathode in the electrorefiner
enables the uranium deposit on the cathodes to be stripped off spontaneously, resulting in a continuous
reaction. The collected uranium deposits at the bottom of the inner cone of the reactor are transferred by a
conveyer. The residuals in the anode basket after the uranium is depleted are noble metals. These are also
collected at the bottom of the outer shell of the reactor, and conveyed from the reactor for a further
treatment. This work addresses the design of the electrorefiner for a continuous operation. The behavior
of particles such as uranium dendrites or noble metals was analyzed to achieve the proper operating
conditions. The operating conditions for the cathode processor in which molten salt is distilled were also
investigated.},

In the electrochemical reduction process, oxides fuels are loaded at the cathode basket in molten Li2O–LiCl salt and electrochemically reduced to the metal form. Various approaches based on thermodynamic calculations and experimental studies have been used to understand the electrode reaction and efﬁciently treat spent fuels. The factors that affect the speed of the electrochemical reduction have been determined to optimize the process and scale-up the electrolysis cell. In addition, demonstrations of the integrated series of processes (electroreﬁning and salt distillation) with the electrochemical reduction have been conducted to realize the oxide fuel cycle. This overview provides insight into the current status of and issues related to the electrochemical processing of spent nuclear fuels.},

Here, we demonstrate an anode structure consisting of graphite tubes and a SiC shroud to be applied to the electrowinning process. A large surface area as well as high corrosion resistivity was achieved through the use of inert graphite tubes. The Cl2 (g) capture was enhanced by the employment of a porous SiC shroud. It also allows an efﬁcient contact of the electrode surface to the LiCl–KCl eutectic melt for an anodic evolution. No signiﬁcant effects of the use of a SiC shroud on the anode overpotential and cell potential were found during the U deposition test.},

	abstract = {A concept of pyroprocessing light water reactor (LWR) spent fuels based on an electrochemical reduction technology is proposed, and the material balance of the processing of mixed oxide (MOX) or high-burnup uranium oxide (UO2) spent fuel is evaluated. Furthermore, a burnup analysis for metal fuel fast breeder reactors (FBRs) is conducted on low-decontamination materials recovered by pyroprocessing. In the case of processing MOX spent fuel (40 GWd/t), UO2 is separately collected for 60 wt\% of the spent fuel in advance of the electrochemical reduction step, and the product recovered through the rare earth (RE) removal step, which has the composition uranium:plutonium:minor actinides:fission products (FPs) = 76.4:18.4:1.7:3.5, can be applied as an ingredient of FBR metal fuel without a further decontamination process. On the other hand, the electroreduced alloy of high-burnup UO2 spent fuel (48 GWd/t) requires further decontamination of residual FPs by an additional process such as electrorefining even if RE FPs are removed from the alloy because the recovered plutonium (Pu) is accompanied by almost the same amount of FPs in addition to RE. However, the amount of treated materials in the electrorefining step is reduced to 10 wt\% of the total spent fuel owing to the prior UO2 recovery step. These results reveal that the application of electrochemical reduction technology to LWR spent oxide fuel is a promising concept for providing FBR metal fuel by a rationalized process.},

In this new electrochemical reduction process, electrolysis of Li2O and reduction of uranium oxide are taking place simultaneously at the cathode part of electrolysis cell. Li produced via Li2O electrolysis reacts with uranium oxide resulting in the formation of Li2O of which oxygen ion originates from uranium oxide. The resultant Li2O is electrolysed and regenerated Li is used for further reduction of the uranium oxide. The cathode part consisted of uranium oxide, stainless steel conductor, and a nonconductive porous magnesia filter. The conversion of uranium oxide to uranium metal reached more than 99\% and closed recycle of Li2O was elucidated by the observation of its concentration variation in molten-salt.},
